                    <ul>
                        <li>Coming into this course, I had an established base of HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge that was acquired from a previous class, which primarily focused on designing websites and webpages with a focal on visual design, and not-so-much the interaction between the userâ€™s web browser and the host web server that is responsible for the presentation of websites. If I had to add a few things to reflect upon, it would be the following:<br /><br /></li>                       
                        <li>1. When it comes to image containers that support animation, I had no idea that the .PNG image file format was one of those containers. I previously believed that only image container that supported animation was the .GIF, but I didn't know subsets of .GIF existed, such as GIF 87a and GIF 89a.<br /><br /></li>
                        <li>2. Until I read Chapter 8 - Extending HTML, I was not aware of the complexities of how webpages are represented on a user's web browser, because I originally believed that the host web server handled everything about the presentation of websites. I now know that it is better for web server balance to offload some of processing burden onto the client, and keep the server stable, and its resources allocated to more critical tasks.<br /><br /></li>
