                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Kevin Kwok, I am a student enrolled in Edmond Community College's Computer Information System's <strong>Web Application</strong> certification route, and I enjoy making websites in HTML5 and CSS3. I coded (and previewed) this very website in a very pretty text editor called <em>Brackets</em>, which is an open-source application published by Adobe  Systems Incorporated. It's their free version of <em>Adobe Dreamweaver</em> on Creative Cloud, which is the first web development-centric application I used to learn HTML5 and CSS3. I am currently adjusting to the <em>Notepad++</em> text editor's GUI, and perhaps, it may become my preferred text editor for all future technical endeavors, outside of web development. I plan on trying the <em>Atom</em> text editor next.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am enthusiastic about computer hardware, and the recent headlines AMD has made with their resurgence in the CPU market with their high-core-count <em>Ryzen</em> computer processors. Unfortunately, I cannot afford the highest-end offerings of AMD's newest CPU architecture, as a 16-core 32-thread <em>Threadripper</em> has an MSRP of $999 USD. Nevertheless, the recent innovation from AMD has spurred a renewed vigor from their longtime CPU-manufacturing competitor, Intel, which has dominated the CPU market for far too long with their practice of releasing marginal updates to their processors, and has been pushing the now-stagnant quad-core CPU core processor for over a decade. Due to the renewed competition between both companies, the future for enthusiast computer builders looks evermore bright.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from web development and computer hardware, I am secretly trying to acquire and learn all mainstream client-and-enterprise-level operating systems, such as Linux (CentOS, Ubuntu), Windows 10 (Server 2016), and mac OS, in order to be more familiar and versatile in each system environment. If I were to one day achieve my dream of becoming a full-stack developer, I will need to know how to effectively implement solutions within each operating system. At present, I want to learn more about mac OS El Capitan and its successors, because I am the least knowledgeable in Apple's production-grade operating system. I also aim to become more familiar with Linux kernels, such as Fedora, Linux Mint, and ones that are based on UNIX, such as FreeBSD.</p>
